/**
 * Extensions are available as part of Activity Definitions, as part of a Statement's "context" property, or as part of a
 * Statement's "result" property. In each case, extensions are intended to provide a natural way to extend those properties
 * for some specialized use. The contents of these extensions might be something valuable to just one application, or it might be a
 * convention used by an entire Community of Practice
 *
 * Extensions are defined by a map and logically relate to the part of the Statement where they are present. The values of an extension
 * can be any JSON value or data structure. Extensions in the "context" property provide context to the core experience,
 * while those in the "result" property provide elements related to some outcome. Within Activities,
 * extensions provide additional information that helps define an Activity within some custom application or Community of Practice.
 * The meaning and structure of extension values under an IRI key are defined by the person who controls the IRI.
 *
 * - The keys of an extensions map MUST be IRIs.
 * - An LRS MUST NOT reject a Statement based on the values of the extensions map.
 * - Learning Record Providers SHOULD always strive to map as much information as possible into the built-in elements in order to
 *   leverage interoperability among Experience API conformant tools.
 * - All extension IRIs SHOULD have controllers.
 * - The controller of an IRL extension key SHOULD make a human-readable description of the intended meaning of the extension supported
 *   by the IRL accessible at the IRL.
